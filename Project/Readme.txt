Readme

To code used in the project is done in R or python. 

For the .R files:
Open the files in Rstudio. The programs can then be execeuted using the Run button in R. The paths would have to be changes, and some directories that may not be present may have to be created. For some files, the code such as Correlation, the code was re-used and hence minor modifications may be required to obtain the same results as we have. Also, the files may contain commented lines that were used for another algorithm. An example is the plotting of the predictions when using Kalman Filtering. These lines would have to un-commented in order to re-obtain the graph plots.

The output was a CSV file [rwf_2004_0.8.csv] which consists of the predictions for years of 2008 and 2012. This file had to be uploaded to the competition website for RMSE and model accuracy computation. 

For the .ipynb files:
These are Ipython notebook files that can be opened in a number of IDEs such as Jupyter. The files can then be executed through the IDE. The other considerations such as file paths and comments still hold.
